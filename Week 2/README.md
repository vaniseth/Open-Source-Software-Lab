# TABLE

* HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
* Each table cell is defined by a `<td>` and a `</td>` tag.
* Each table row starts with a `<tr>` and ends with a `</tr>` tag.
* When you want your cells to be table header cells. In those cases we use the `<th>` tag instead of the `<td>` tag.

# FRAME

* Frames are  used to divide the web browser window into multiple sections where each section can be loaded separately .
* A frameset tag is the collection of frames in the browser window.
* We use the `<iframe>`tag to embed another document within the current HTML document
